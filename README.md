# Floatful
Floatful is a open-source, web based CSS visualizer, editor, debugger, and exporter.

## Floatful Development
Floatful started development in December 2022 by Hunter Ball, as a personal project. It is still massively under development and many features have not been added.

## Contributing
While Floatful is open-source, I am waiting on a more complete skeleton of the app to be finished before collaboration is started. I am currently using the basics of the project to learn React from scratch, and it might take me a while to get some main functionality into the app. Stay tuned for more updates about the development if you are interested in helping!
