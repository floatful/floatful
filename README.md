# Floatful
Floatful is a open-source web application that aims to simplify the CSS styling process for HTML projects. It features an intuitive,
user-friendly interface that allows developers to create and test styles, modify components, add medua query rules, and export to CSS.

## Floatful Features
The following are the features we are hoping to include in the first public release, and some features that will be in development after (indicated with *):

- Drag and drop interface allowing easy creation of elements, parents and children, and other CSS selectors
- Resize padding, margins, width, height, and border radii, all within the visual layout.
- Create media query rulesets with maximum/minimum rules to enforce elements behave on smaller screens.
- Create and use "style fragments"- saved groups of reusable rules- in order to add similar styles to multiple components
- Export selected components and styles to CSS when you're done
- *Export to other style languages like LESS, SCSS, and SASS

The development of Floatful is still ongoing and there are more features to come, such as the ability to export styles to CSS derivatives like SASS and LESS. If you're a web developer who wants to streamline your CSS workflow, or simply looking to contribute to an open-source project, Floatful is the perfect opportunity. The app is actively seeking contributions from the development community, so don't hesitate to join the project and help shape the future of Floatful.

## Floatful Development
Floatful began development in December 2022. It is still in it's infancy stages, so many features are not inplemented or incomplete. 
A full public release is expected late 2023 or early 2024, depending on contribution, development, and other unforseen circumstances.

## Contributing
While Floatful is open-source and I would love to have contributers, I'd like to create a more complete skeleton of the application before full open-source contribution is necessary. Being transparent, this is my first react project and I am learning as I create this application.

That being said, I would never turn down help, and if you're looking to get into development or learnign React as well, I would love to have you on the team, working and learning together. Please reach out if contributing to Floatful is something you'd be interested in!
